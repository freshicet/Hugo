# Surprise! The Hidden Page Has Been Found!

## A Poem About Cats and you!

In the depths of cyberspace, a secret laid,
A hidden page where secrets played.
But my dear wife, with eyes so bright,
Unveiled its magic with her delight.

Oh, how our lives have intertwined,
Like feline grace, so undefined.
With each gentle purr and loving stare,
You bring warmth and joy beyond compare.

Just like cats with their curious ways,
You explore the depths and brighten my days.
Your spirit, fierce and yet so kind,
Is a treasure I'm grateful to call mine.

From playful paws to gentle strokes,
Our love, a bond that never chokes.
Together we'll roam this digital land,
Hand in hand, united we'll stand.

So here's to you, my dearest love,
Like cats, we fit, snug as a glove.
Thank you for discovering this hidden delight,
Forever cherished, in my heart's soft light.
